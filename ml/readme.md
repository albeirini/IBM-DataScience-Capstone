## Machine Learning Artifacts

This folder is reserved for machine learning artifacts such as trained models,
model evaluation outputs, or serialized objects.

For this project, machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM,
Decision Tree, and KNN) were trained, tuned, and evaluated directly within
Jupyter notebooks using GridSearchCV.

No serialized models were stored, as the goal of this project was exploratory
and comparative analysis rather than model deployment.
